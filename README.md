# Slack Track
Tracks changes to the user base of your Slack instance across a given time period

## Note: WIP
This is a work-in-progress made for my own use. It will have many breaking changes until it gets a 0.1 version, which may never come.
You are free to use and build upon this if you want, but should in no way expect it to be good or consistent.

### Requirements
1. Most mainstream Linux distros are "supported". Works on macOS too. Hasn't been extensively tested though (see: WIP).  
2. Also have Python 3.6+ installed.


### Getting started
1. Clone the repo  
2. Run `./setup.sh`  
3. Fill out the info it requests from you  
  a. Profit.  
  b. If you don't want it to run automatically and instead wish to develop with this, be sure to select "manually" when
asked how often the script should run.  
4. Sit back for a while (week or so at minimum) while the script collects data, and then use whatever tools you would like
to compare this data.


### Plans for the future
1. Reports -- automatically generate reports with colorful graphs and whatever else managers like to look at when it
comes to analytics, embedded as standalone HTML docs that can be easily shared or uploaded to Confluence or hosted
on your web server.
2. Easy-to-navigate DB tools, probably utilizing a local webserver to interact with your data and find whatever you want.
