# Slack Track
Tracks changes to the user base of your Slack instance across a given time period

## Note: WIP
This is a work-in-progress made for my own use. It will have many breaking changes until it gets a 0.1 version, which may never come.
You are free to use and build upon this if you want, but should in no way expect it to be good or consistent.

### Requirements
1. Most mainstream Linux distros are "supported". Probably works on macOS. I haven't tried.  
2. Also have Python 3.6+ installed.


### Getting started
1. Clone the repo  
2. Run `./setup.sh`  
3. Fill out the info it requests from you  
4. Should just work from there.


### Contributing
Fork it and open a pull request.


### Is there a warranty or anything
Nah
