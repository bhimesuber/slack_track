Edit this file with whatever reports you would like to run each time the main slack_track.py file runs.
The reports.main function will be executed by slack_track's main function.
The reports.main function takes a DatabaseTools object as an argument, so can be directly interacted with, rather
than having to construct a second object to use to run reports.
